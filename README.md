Awesome Old Game Remakes
========================

âš  Obsoleted by [Open Source Game Clones](https://osgameclones.com/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/opengaming/osgameclones)).

---

Inspired by [awesome][].

This is a curated list of awesome open-source remakes of old games (if the old
game itself is open-source, then it qualifies, too!). The remakes doesn't have
to be finished products; game engines to play games in present of original
content would qualify, too.

Contributions are welcome!
